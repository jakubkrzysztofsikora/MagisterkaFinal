# Master Thesis from Computer Science
This simple tool will be used to analize, examine and describe a few major pathfinding algorithms. 

## What it can do?

- Create custom graph or generate a random one
- Set starting and target nodes
- Choose algorithm you want to analize
- Start simulation and observe algorithm monitoring subtool
- Generate reports for each algorithm and perform closer examination

## Why?
Pathfinding in Graphs and other more complicated structures is part of so called AI in video games, so I thought it would be good to know how it works.

The project is more about me to practice programming skills, framework/theoretical knowledge, thats the only reason it exists. I like to code and forunetaly I can do it in my free time without any business reason.

And of course I won't mind getting a master degree thanks to that.
